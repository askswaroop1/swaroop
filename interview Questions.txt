Rules
 


BatchProcess::
BatchProcessType.ttx and mention the custom batch name

You extend the BatchProcessBase base class by providing your own implementation of the doWork abstract
method that BatchProcessBase inherits from its super class, SinglePhaseBatchProcess.

Your custom batch process must extend the BatchProcessBase Gosu class. You must override the abstract
doWork method, which takes no arguments. You can override other methods, but it is not strictly necessary as the
base class defines meaningful defaults.


The doWork method does not have a bundle to track the database transaction. To modify data, you must use the
Transaction.runWithNewBundle(...) API to create a bundle.

Exclusive(){ return false}--it will allow multiple batches to process at a time.
